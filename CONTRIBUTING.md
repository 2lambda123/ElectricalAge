### Translations

Is the mod not available in your language or are some translations missing?
Well you can change that by adding or modifying a translation:

We use Transifex as localization platform. Create an account and ask to join the
[ELN Team](https://www.transifex.com/electrical-age/eln/) on Transifex to translate the mod into your language. No
coding skills are required at all.

Some translation strings might contain placeholders for runtime arguments in order to include numbers or other runtime
objects into the sentence. These are identified by **%N$** whereas *N* is the number of the argument in the argument
list (at runtime). A translation string should include these placeholders too at the appropriate position in the text.
